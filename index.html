            <h3>Software Engineer enthusiast.</h3>
            <p>Having taken a career path that was totally different from this new one in programming, 
            I found it really daunting at first as I have had to readjust so many things I was already used to. Sacrifices were made
            bonds were broken. What kept me going was the goal I had set for myself. I also kept telling myself that,
            "I was made for more" I am grateful for a platform like TIIDELab they have made the whole process very easy &#128522;. </p>
